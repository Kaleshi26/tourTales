			About Us
			</h1>
			<p class="aboutus-paragraph">TourTales is a Sri Lankan based
				Online Tour Guide designed to enhance our passengers travel
				experience by offering a smooth way to explore and book exciting
				tour packages from the comfort of your home. With each package, we
				provide a professional tour guide and a vehicle to ensure an
				enjoyable and memorable trip. The guide will accompany our
				passengers throughout the journey, offering guidance and assistance,
				while the booked vehicle ensures smooth transportation between
				destinations. Our goal is to create a stress-free, informative, and
				personalized travel experience that fulfills all our passengers'
				needs, making the trip memorable and enriching. Any individual can
				visit the page and check the available packages and the vehicles.
				There are a variety of customized tour packages such as adventure,
				heritage, wildlife and many more. By set a date, and a pickup
				location with the number of participants the Online Tour Guide
				suggests the available vehicles according the given number of
				participants. Booking and payments can made when an individual gets
				logged in to the system providing the user credentials. If one is
				new to TourTales, a new account can be made by providing necessary
				details. Payments can be done using cards or bank transfer. When a
				booking is confirmed, a confirmation message will be sent to the
